    <p>Bangladesh experiences a monsoon climate, characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons. The rainy season in Bangladesh typically occurs during the southwest monsoon, which generally spans from June to October. During this period, warm and moist air from the Bay of Bengal moves inland, bringing heavy rainfall to the region.</p>

    <p>The peak of the rainy season in Bangladesh is usually in July and August. During this time, the country receives a significant amount of rainfall, leading to flooding in low-lying areas and riverbanks. The heavy rains are crucial for the country's agriculture, as they contribute to the cultivation of rice and other crops.</p>

    <p>While the rainy season is essential for agriculture, it can also bring challenges such as flooding, landslides, and waterlogging in urban areas. The government and various organizations in Bangladesh often engage in preparedness and response activities to mitigate the impact of these challenges on communities.

<h1>Autunm:</h1>
<p>
    Sarat ritu is followed immediately after the rainy season. It falls in the months of Bhadra and Aswin. It is the most suitable season for the tourists since the sky would be filled with patches of light clouds and winds, but there would be no trace of rain. People can spend time with their families during picnics since the days would be warm, perfect for a get-together. </p>

<p>In this season, there’s a gradual decrease in humidity. During Sarat ritu, many fishes are found in the rivers. Jute, the cash crop, is mainly harvested in this season. Flowers such as Mallika, roses, lotus and other aquatic flowers bloom during the Sarat ritu. Durga puja is celebrated with grandeur during this time to welcome the winter season.
